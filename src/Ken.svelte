      <TimesBody>“‘Auto-Momus’- Lem explains- is to be free creation ’squared,’ because the critic of the text, if placed within that very text, will have more possibilities for maneuvering than the narrator of traditional or nontraditional literature.  One might go along with this, for in fact literature nowadays fights for greater distance from the thing created, like a runner on his second wind.”</TimesBody>

          Though I had been taking further conceptual notes regarding the Momentum 5 project, Stammer Triptych, since the initial ideas were set in motion during September of 2019, the real compositional activity didn't start until November.  From September 24th until November 2nd I was touring in Europe with a series of projects, two of which included written material (Exercises, with Håvard Wiik, Christof Kurzmann, and Michael Thieke; and Entr'acte, a band that included Dieb13, Elisabeth Harnik, Steve Heather, Terrie Hessels, Didi Kern, Christof Kurzmann, Mette Rasmussen, Jasper Stadhouders, Joe Williamson, and Nate Wooley, and had a week-long residency in Krakow with rehearsals and small group performances running from October 22nd to 27th, with the full ensemble performing a brand new piece dedicated to Katarzyna Kobro, featuring Christof improvising with, and electronically processing, a series of instrumental combinations.  This meant there was no extra time to work directly on the Stammer Triptych material until I got back home, two weeks before the Momentum 5 performance at Elastic Arts in Chicago on November 14th.

          There were several structural decisions made regarding the Stammer Triptych piece before I left for Europe. The most essential was placing an illustration of "process" at the forefront (the composition was directly inspired by the piece I Am Sitting in a Room by Alvin Lucier and the film Film Feedback by Tony Conrad).  I order to do so, I decided to create pre-composed elements that would be presented in a series of three 20 minute segments, along with a video created by Kim Alpert that would be screened and processed in real time, side by side, also three times.  The other primary considerations were the actual personnel: the idea of an ensemble that would be a double quartet with Tim Barnes, Nick Macri, Lou Mallozzi, and Mars Williams representing one of the quartets, and Katinka Kleijn, Damon Locks, Claire Rousay, and myself as the other; the combination of "clock time" with "musical time"; and providing a parameter that would allow Damon and Lou to only use text-based, spoken word recordings as source material.

          Before leaving for Europe at the end of September, I met with Kim to talk about the technical parameters for the video work involved, which was extremely helpful and triggered a number of new conceptual ideas.  When I returned from my tour, I got together with Damon and Lou to discuss what might be possible regarding their use of pre-recorded and sampled vocal components.  That discussion was also a huge help, particularly in regards to strategies that would prevent any of the fundamental elements of the piece (conventional composition, recordings and processing of voices, and video) from taking precedence over the others from the audience perspective.  This is something that John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Robert Rauschenberg achieved with their collaborations, and I was hoping to accomplish the same with this project as well.

          Once I started the actual operation of composing, I realized that playing the piece in three sequential versions, with breaks in between, would interrupt the idea of "process" too severely (both Lucier and Conrad's pieces illustrated the evolution of their materials as an ongoing, continuous evolution).  I therefore chose to add improvised segues between the first and second versions of composed material, and again between the second and third, featuring each quartet separately in these sections.  The structural implications and challenge of this decision were severe- how to create a single, identifiable 20 minute composition that would be transformed twice, with open and improvised interludes, that would last close to 80 minutes in duration.  It meant organizing the longest composition that I had written up until to that point, utilizing elements I had never worked with before, finishing the material and transcribing all the parts in less than ten days; the first rehearsal was scheduled on November 11th and I had arrived home on the 2nd.

          Deadlines are remarkable things.  I'd write in two sessions on most days that week, in the morning and afternoon.  When an idea would run into a dead end, I'd leave it and return to it later- somehow my brain would work on the problem and almost always solve it for me on an unconscious level.  The concept of "process" connected itself to my musical thinking as a fugue, and I spent my time away from composing listening to Bach, Nancarrow, Ruth Crawford Seeger, and the Große Fuge by Beethoven.  The first version of the piece featured the strings, with an opening fugue as the initial part, its mirror written as the second part.  This section was followed by a version featuring the horns, which began with a fugue based on the string's "mirror" and then concluded with a mirror of that mirror.  Musical time was defined differently in each version, strings in a mid tempo "waltz," horns performing over grooves played on electric bass and constructed from the composed lines for the other instruments.  The third variation combined the written components from the previous two, but with Nick and Mars paired, working from both string and horn themes, and with Katinka and I paired, doing the same but utilizing different parts.

          Throughout the piece, the ensemble followed a clock that designated specific events that would occur at specific times during each 20 minute segment.  This allowed the music to coincide with the length of Kim's video work, and made it possible to integrate the "musical time" of notated elements with a "chronological time" that indicated the entrances/exits of the recordings/samples of Damon and Lou, plus entrances/exits for improvisers who would be interacting spontaneously with all of this activity.  The places where both the pulse of musical time and the clock of chronological time were abandoned were during the improvised segues, which were completely free for the quartets and unscripted.  The entire composition finished with a coda that was constructed from the electric bass grooves from part two, played by both bass and cello, and finished with the vocal recordings/samples layered on top of each other, over and over again (another nod to the influences of I Am Sitting in a Room by Lucier and Film Feedback by Conrad), while the drums maintained energy and built to the composition's finale.  In any case, that was the plan.

    <TimesBody>As mentioned, the first day of rehearsal was scheduled for Monday, November 11th.  Chicago was hit with a snowstorm that morning and Claire and Tim, who were flying in from out of town (San Antonio and Louisville, respectively), were both delayed for more than 12 hours, finally arriving in Chicago but well past the end of the rehearsal time.  Luckily, the string and horn players were able to meet and we got some important, preliminary work done.  Hearing the written components on their own, without percussion or recordings and samples, and without improvisation, was completely nerve-racking for me.  The next day, when Claire and Tim joined the rehearsal, felt much, much better.  On Wednesday the 13th, the entire ensemble met at Elastic Arts to setup and rehearse from 3pm to 9pm.  We were able to leave our equipment in place for the concert the next night, which was a huge advantage for the performance- we could work on all the material and ideas, verify sight lines, get used to the volume and balance in the room, and not have to tear down everything and put it back together the next evening before the gig.  An added bonus was that the recording engineer, Dave Zuchowski, could be there both for the rehearsal and concert so all of his gear was also situated properly.</TimesBody>
    <TimesBody>This is a rough overview of what went into the second half of realizing the Momentum 5: Stammer Triptych project.  It doesn't convey all the effort everyone put into making this endeavor possible, which was extraordinary.  In addition to verifying those contributions, I'd like to note what a success the concert was.  Due to time constraints the music and visuals were never performed in full until the time of the concert.  Despite this, and though my expectations were high, the musicians' performances were exceptional and more than I could have hoped for.  Everyone maintained the necessary creative tension to hold the architecture behind this 80 minutes of music hold in place and, what's more, built its intensity from the start up to and through the finale.  There were so many unprecedented and unscripted moments that the musicians found and put into play- things I could never have anticipated and which would have been impossible to notate in advance.  It was a sensational evening, matched by an incredible audience, I think the largest I've ever played to at Elastic Arts, who matched the ensemble's energy and focus throughout the performance.  My thanks goes out to all the musicians and listeners for their contributions, to Dave Zuchowski for documenting the proceedings, and to Dave Rempis and the staff at Elastic for giving us the opportunity.</TimesBody>
