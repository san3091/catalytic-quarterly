      Feedback &amp; Uplift: An Interview with Luke Stewart
    </SansTitle>
    <SansBody>By Sam Clapp</SansBody>
    <SansBody>################</SansBody>
    <SansBody>
Bassist, community organizer, radio producer, and writer Luke Stewart has been a linchpin of the Washington, DC music scene for the last decade. In bands like Heart of the Ghost, Irreversible Entanglements, and Low Ways Quartet, and as a curator, he’s worked tirelessly to create and promote uncompromising music.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
Catalytic Sound manager Sam Clapp talked with Stewart about his new band Blacks’ Myths with drummer Warren “Trae” Crudup III, his relationship with creative music, his experiments with feedback and collaboration, and the broader project of community uplift through music.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody >
      <span class="question">Could you talk about how Blacks’ Myths got started?</span>
    </SansBody>
     <SansBody>
       Trae and I have been playing together for a really long time. In fact, one of the first times we ever played duo together was back in 2011. We did a performance here in DC with Ernest Dawkins, Joe Bowie, Adam Rudolph, and Lewis “Flip” Barnes. That was wonderful. It was one of our first forays into creative music, and it was was sort of our onstage initiation into the legacy and tradition of creative music, as they told us that night.
     </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      During that performance, during the second set, we all started playing together, and at some point early on in the set, they all sort of left the stage, and left Trae and I to perform duo for the rest of the set. 
    </SansBody> 
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Was that a surprise?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      Yeah it was, it was a total surprise. And apparently, as we were told later by Ernest and Joe, this is what goes on in the AACM tradition. You’re basically left to create on your own. That was my first time to do that as a musician.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Where were you coming from before that? Were you improvising?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
Yeah, I was improvising, I was coming from a lot of different musical places at that time. I was still a saxophone player as well as a bass player. I still identified a lot more as a multi-instrumentalist. I was making hip-hop stuff, trying to do DJ stuff, various forms of electronic music in that vein. I had just recently come off of an intense, well, normally intense classical saxophone study in school. I was playing in sax quartets and stuff like that.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
I was a couple of years into doing the jam session thing, and playing straight ahead jazz. By that time I already dove into the world of creative music, but I always come back to that particular experience as an initiation, even though it wasn’t my first foray into improvisation. It was my first foray with an elder in improvisation. That experience was when Trae and I entered into that world together. It’s been like that ever since.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
The musical synergy between us comes from the fact we’ve played together all the time in various groups. So when we come together it’s very very easy. It’s almost automatic.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Do you talk about what you’re going to do in advance?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
Yeah. Everything is pre-determined. The songs have a structure for improvisation, for vibe. The way I like to write in general and especially for this group—it works well with smaller groups—is to create a vibe. A vibe is established and you can build within that vibe as an improviser. That’s what everything is with us.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
We talk about what we’re gonna play, or maybe I’ll have an idea or a sequence in mind, and I’ll play that, and Trae just creates within it. I might not even tell him anything—I’ll just have it in my head.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">The tracks that are on the album—are these improvised, or semi-improvised?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
What you hear on the album is a perfect example. I had a series of ideas in my head—motifs and figures and things like that. And we just went into the studio and played what was in my mind. We just did that like all day, for like 8 hours. But we left room for exploration as well. That’s what you’re hearing on the album.
      </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Do you identify with the AACM idea of creative music?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
Yeah, absolutely. I would say that that way of thinking, especially about organizing, having forays into the community, and ultimately taking control and responsibility over your own creativity, is the biggest lesson that I see from there. I very much identify with that philosophy that they and so many others had at the same time.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">How did you come into contact with that idea of creative music?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
Really from being a listener. From when I was  a young teenager, first getting serious about music and listening to music and investigating the different pathways that different albums take you on. You’ll listen to a particular album and then you’ll see that this bass player is on it, or that this saxophone player is on it, who also has a bunch of crazy albums. Or such-and-such produced it. That help you navigate the different concepts.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
So though that navigation, in jazz obviously, led me eventually to the Art Ensemble and to Braxton and to Wadada, and then that led me to an investigation of what that music was really all about. Once I moved to DC, I started to meet people who had real life experience with these people who could explain further, and show examples of what they had done, as show examples of how it was a larger movement of self-determination and music for the purpose of community uplift. That sort of jettisoned me into the work that I continue to do.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Do you see your curation and organizing work in that context of community uplift?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
Absolutely. I would say that a couple of people were really important to that—Bobby Hill in DC is one of them—as well as Tom Porter and Bob Daugherty at WPFW 89.3 FM. The moniker is “jazz and justice.” So you can imagine what’s going on. Those individuals especially showed key things—key books, key recordings, introduced me to people. I met Ernest Dawkins through Bobby Hilll. And Bobby Hill put on that concert I mentioned before. I want to make sure to mention those individuals because they are definitely important and are people who have made a big impact here and in my life.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Can you tell me about Works for Upright Bass &amp; Amplifier? [a piece that explores the feedback generated in the interaction of bass and amp.]</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
I’m very interest in naiveté and a childlike approach to music and the discovery that is possible there, the communication that happens with yourself and the environment and the audience.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">When you’re performing that piece, are you in a normal performance mindset?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
Performing solo and with a group, for me, is very different, especially with that particular project, that setup. I’m developing a larger performance piece with this concept currently. They are different mindsets, completely.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
The new [version of the piece] is a performance piece with Miriam Parker, the dancer. We’ve had some very wonderful opportunities to perform. Basically the idea is that we’re encompassing as many sensory elements as possible. We have the sound being generated by myself and an ensemble. She is choreographing movement with other dancers, as well as a visual images with Pat [Cain, video artist].
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
It was sort of realized last year when we played the New Ear Fest in New York, which was at the Fridman Gallery. It’s a festival of contemporary music, with some legends. We shared a bill with Mary Lucier, who was Alvin’s wife when he was performing I am Sitting in a Room. She had a visual component to go along with that.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      I was generating the sound and light movement needed to make [feedback] happen. Miriam choreographed her own movement. In the same way that I was describing, I set up these improvisational structures, these zones, these vibes, that create an arc for the performance. She also sets up almost literal structures using different material hung on the wall, going from the wall to the floor, using paint on herself, and the way that she moves. And that’s alongside Pat, doing the visual feedback to accompany my sonic feedback.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">I’m curious about how the parts relate to each other, and if that’s a big concern of yours, or if they’re independent elements that are just alongside each other.</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
I like that question because it touches on the classic conundrum of free improvisation with other people. And I consider this, not free improvisation, but improvisationally based. In an ensemble in an improv music situation, is the goal to create independently and in that independence comes together a cohesive sound? Or is the concept that we’re each working together and feeding off of each other and creating a focused sound? Or is it somewhere in between, or is it a combination?
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
For this particular project for that particular trio, in my mind it’s all sort of building, almost creating a 3-D effect, where you’re getting feedback from the sound and the sonic modulation, and also the cosmic information that travels in the vibration, and then the visual feedback generated by my movement, and then that’s building on the sound, and is a part of the sound. And then you have a moving artist, a movement artist, who is also creating based on the sound and also emitting her own vibration, and then the projections are also capturing that vibration as well. I think as opposed to a traditional music ensemble, with that configuration it’s naturally going to build upon each other, because I’m looking at the dancer, the dancer is listening to me, and the video artist is interacting with us both and drawing inspiration from us both. There’s a lot of that.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
The process of working with Miriam over the last year has made me much more aware of the movement aspect. It’s not that I need to move with this, or so-called dance with this. The process of generating sound and making the music itself requires it. And I guess the way that it happens is needed in order to physically generate what I want to happen, to actually generate the feedback, which I don’t think is done so much.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Thinking about work that Ben Lamar Gay, Kim Alpert, and Ken Vandermark are doing here in Chicago with feedback, it feels like this interest in feedback could be a reaction to the number of options that we have now musically. You can do so much so easily, that stripping things back is maybe one of the more interesting things you can do.</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      Exactly, and especially using feedback with the most normal of setups, which is a bass and an amp. It might seem like a tongue-and-cheek title. But it’s very literal. It’s like, read the words for what they are. People have said it’s amplified bass. That’s different in my mind from bass &amp; amplifier. Because “amplified bass” just means you make the bass louder. If you turn it up really loud, you start to hear the different sub tones and harmonics that come out if you employ different techniques.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      Then there’s the element of the amplifier, which is why it’s Works for Amplified Bass &amp; Amplifier rather than works for amplified bass. I’m going up to the amplifier, and twisting knobs, and working with EQ to highlight different frequencies, different pitches within the instrument and within the feedback that’s being generated. It’s almost like a coming together of the pure acoustic sound of the upright bass and the pure electronic sound of the amplifier. And that generates that level of feedback that can then be harnessed and controlled.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      Going back to the independence and codependence concepts in improvisation—when you’re working codependently with a dancer, its a completely different mindset than working with a saxophone player or a musical instrument, or even with a film, or some sort of visual thing.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">How do feel about your journey the last couple of years?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
I think it’s all connected. The last couple of years specifically have been definitely more focused on performance than years on the past, when I was working as a radio producer, as an organizer around music and in other things, in the community. Now I’m working more as a musician, and also writing abut music and finding more ways to evangelize for the music and for this artistic approach, and of its possibilities and applications for more people. That’s always been a part of my philosophy—to be able to explain the music. I have to be able to come up to my parents and the older people in my family about what I am doing. I want connect with you—with the community that is passionate and interested in these concepts—but also wanting to reach more people, to expose more people to this concept, to what’s happening in this world.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Do you feel like you’re able to explain it to your family? Do they get it?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      My mom gets it.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">Is that because your mom is cool, or because you’re explaining it well?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
I don’t know! I think it’s because she’s just seen a lot. And I’ve definitely explained it to her a lot, and she understands. It’s completely foreign to her. She played the violin in school, but she quit that after she left school. So like, she knows music, but she doesn’t have any sort of concept about anything even remotely connected to this world. So yeah, I’m very proud of my mom. And you know, other people in my family, I think they’re all very proud, with varying levels of understanding.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
      <span class="question">What do you think prevents people from getting it, in general?</span>
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
There are so many things. I’m not so sure that people straight-up don’t get it. I’m not sure that it’s a thing to get. The way that I’ve experienced art working is when it’s generating a reaction, it’s generating a feeling within somebody, whether that feeling is good or bad. What you don’t want is indifference. Especially reading about the history of the music, and the contemporary innovations in the music, the various battles, aesthetic battles. To take it back to the free jazz conversation, the battles they had to go through with the jazz establishment, the people that, the music industry establishment, the socialite/social scene establishment, all the various macro and micro battles that had to take place. And those people aren’t even remembered, so we can’t even start from that place. We’re starting largely from a place of “Wait, who was that again? And who is this other person?” I think for me it’s ultimately about making people understand that sound has potential for change and development in your state of being as a human. Allowing yourself to be physically and mentally open to allow yourself to evolve, essentially, not in a Darwinian sense, but in your own personal development. And how that can have an impact on you as an individual, and on people as a society.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
There are so many distractions we’ve created. The mechanisms are strong for us to just retreat into a hole, a personal bubble where your concept of the outside world is through a screen, where you can get things delivered to you. You don’t have to physically do anything, really. People are living their entire lives on laptops, in their room.
    </SansBody>
    <SansBody>
The music corresponds to a greater societal battle that we’re engaged in. How to inspire? How make an impact? How to evangelize for this thing that is a pathway, that is a tool for self and collective betterment? How can we create a platform to expose people to that idea, to the point where we can at least enter that conversation a little more, and engaged by more people? How can we avail ourselves of more opportunities to change lives?
